## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
- My name is **Subhajit Sarkar**.  
- I’m 21 years old and recently finished my **BCA**.  
- I’ve always been curious about **machines and computers**, which pulled me into programming and tech.  
- I enjoy working on projects that **make life easier** — even small ones that solve everyday problems.  
- Right now, I’m learning the **MERN stack**, slowly building my way toward becoming a better developer.  

---

## 🛠️ What I’ve Learned So Far
- **Programming basics:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, a little bit of Java  
- **Concepts:** Data Structures & Algorithms  
- **Tools I use:** Linux, Docker, Git/GitHub, Notion  
- **Creative side:** Figma, Photoshop  
- Always trying to combine these to build something useful.

## 📚 Currently Learning
I’m focused on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  
It feels exciting because I can see how the pieces come together to build real apps.

## 🌱 Why I Do This
I don’t just like coding for the sake of it.  
I like the idea of **fixing problems with technology** and making tools that actually help someone.  

Even if it’s small — if it saves time, reduces hassle, or teaches me something new — that’s worth building.
